              <summary> How do Combat Achievements work with tasks?</summary>
              <p>You can work on tasks in a certain tier when the equivalent tier has been completed in the spreadsheet as long as you have all necessary requirements for it. (no grinding to 62 Slayer to kill a Wyrm just because you’ve completed Easy Tier)</p>
              <p>e.g. 100% Easy Tier completion means being able to go and do Easy Combat Achievement tasks whenever you want.</p>
              <p>There is no requirement to complete these, it's just an option to go for them.</p>

              <p>Food and potions: You can fish Karambwan, Minnows and Anglerfish for food. You can make potions for training Herblore to make a Rejuvenation Pool, or when a level is needed for raids. You can also freely do birdhouse runs.</p>

              <summary>What happens if I mess up (accidentally starting/finishing a quest, overtraining a skill, etc)?</summary>
              <p>Let people know when you’re submitting for a rank up in the Discord, and explain what happened. These rules are very much self-enforced, and the only thing you’re getting judged for is Discord Ranks and Clan Ranks.</p>
              <p>The best advice is stick to the basic idea of Shop > Drop > Skill > Quest, and triple-check the OSRS Wiki before you start any questing/skilling to make absolutely sure that you need to do it this way.</p>

                <strong>Note: This applies to the Recipe for Disaster subquests, not the entire Recipe for Disaster quest. Can’t do the entire quest until Barrows Gloves are required for a clue step or a diary.</strong>

              <summary>I just started, what can I use for food?</summary>
              <p>Some good possibilities are wines from Draynor (recommended if not using melee), kebabs, stews from any bar, or gnome food from the Grand Tree. Potatoes from the warriors’ guild are best once unlocked.</p>

              <p>No. If you need a specific Slayer task, use your points for skips to get it, and otherwise use Turael skips until you get it. Turael skipping means you get a task, and if it isn't the task you need, you cancel it by doing a Turael task. Make sure to block Kalphites before doing so!</p>

              <summary>Can I kill boss variants on a regular Slayer task?</summary>
              <p>In Hard Tier and above,you are allowed to unlock Like a Boss, and also, when receiving a Slayer task with a boss variant (such as Gargoyles/Kalphites/Dagannoths) you are allowed to do a max of 35 of the boss variant, plus an additional 5 kills for each tier of Combat Achievement Rewards you have unlocked (corresponding with the +5 kill increases on assigned boss tasks). (This does not apply when receiving a unique from that certain boss is your active task, or when the task is Kraken.)</p>

If you have Giants’ Foundry unlocked from a previous task, you may train at Giants’ Foundry provided you do not use those points for future tasks (you may use the points to unlock moulds as those are not log slots).</p>

    <h3><u>Overview</u></h3>
    <p>This guide is for task accounts that need early farming levels, especially levels 1-34, and have few available teleports. Once you hit 34 Farming, if you still need more levels, you’re allowed (and advised) to get 100% Hosidius favor and do the rest of your training at Tithe Farm.</p>
    
    <h5><u>General Strategy</u></h5>
    <p>The bulk of your experience will come from making supercompost by buying pineapples from charter ships and using the supercompost on your plants. The other xp will come from planting and harvesting crops.</p>
    <p><strong>*Note: This guide does not include farming hops during your farm runs. While doing early-level farming myself, I found I didn’t have enough time for them, so I’m skipping their inclusion.</strong></p>

    <h5><u>Initial Preparation</u></h5>
    <p>Before starting your farm runs, you’ll want to do some preparation.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Buy a boatload of pineapples from charter ships or the Grand Tree food store. Catherby or Port Khazard charter stores are both good options because they’re close to a bank. 200-300 is a good starting amount.</li>
      <li>Get some allotment and flower seeds (instructions below). A hundred or so are good to start with.</li>
      <li>Buy 4 or 5 bucket packs from Sarah in the Falador farming store (in the house west of the farming patches) and deposit the buckets into a tool leprechaun at any farming spot. These are for holding supercompost.</li>
      <li>Get some cash. Charters are not cheap, but they’re the best way to get around with no teles. Getting an inventory of steel plates in the wilderness with a looting bag is the most straightforward way to do this.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5><u>Obtaining Seeds</u></h5>
    <ol>
      <li>Do you have 38 Thieving?</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Pickpocket Master Farmers</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Otherwise, buy seeds from Olivia in Draynor Village. The best type of allotment seed she stocks is cabbage, and the best flower seed she stocks is rosemary.</li>
    </ol>

    <h5><u>What to do at the farms</u></h5>
    <p>Time to actually gain xp. Do this by running to any number of allotment patches and doing the following actions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Withdraw buckets from the leprechaun, grab the 15 supercompost you made last run, then deposit the super compost into the leprechaun.</li>
      <li>Use 15 more pineapples on the compost bin to start making more super compost.</li>
      <li>Harvest your completed crops, and use them on the leprechaun to turn them into notes and save inventory space.</li>
      <li>Plant your allotment and flower seeds. Use your supercompost on them. Not only does this keep the plants alive, but you get xp for using the compost.</li>
      <li>Head to the next patch!</li>
    </ul>

    <h5><u>What patches should I use?</u></h5>
    <p>There are 4 patches you can consider using for early game training:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Falador Farm</li>
      <li>Catherby</li>
      <li>Ardy Farm</li>
      <li>Hosidius Farm</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You don’t have to do all of them. Maybe you only have the time/run energy to do three of the patches. That’s fine. Or you might find it too annoying to run all the way to Hosidius. That’s cool too.</p>


    <h5><u>With zero teleports, one possible rotation can look like:</u></h5>
    <ol>
      <li>Home teleport to Lumbridge.</li>
      <li>Run to the Falador farm.</li>
      <li><strong>Farm in Falador.</strong></li>
      <li>Run to Port Sarim and take the charter to Catherby.</li>
      <li><strong>Farm in Catherby.</strong></li>
      <li>Take the charter back to Port Sarim.</li>
      <li>Run west to the boat in Rimmington that takes you to Ardougne/Brimhaven. Take it to Ardougne. Run to the Ardougne farming patch.</li>
      <li><strong>Farm in Ardougne.</strong></li>
      <li>Minigame tele to Pest Control, then take the boat back to Port Sarim.</li>
      <li>Run to Veos in the northernmost boat section, and take the boat to Zeah.</li>
      <li>Run to the Hosidius farming patch.</li>
      <li><strong>Farm in Hosidius.</strong></li>
      <li>Repeat!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Your situation may be different: absolutely zero cash, so you scrimp on charters and run more; under 40 combat so you can't use the Pest Control tele, etc. Let this guide give you an idea of potential routes and then work within your boundaries.</p>


    <p>Once you get some teleports, this can be shortened dramatically. Falador and Camelot teleports really help out, as does the Xeric’s Talisman teleport. Also, once you go into Tithe Farm one time, you can start using the Tithe Farm minigame tele for future farm runs.

      Tip: If you get a Garden Pie from Young or Gourmet implings or the Cooking Guild, you can boost to get into Tithe Farm at 31 Farming to unlock the teleport 3 levels early.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Enter Ancient Cavern.</li>
      <li>Wait 10 minutes to lose aggro. Runelite's "NPC Aggression Timer" plugin can show you how long you need to wait. (You don't have to, but you risk getting slapped by a dragon on the way down)</li>
      <li>Step on the marked tile. That tile is inconveniently one step outside the aggro range.</li> <img class="mb-4 mt-4" src="/static/assets/ancient_page_safespot_guide.png" alt="ancient page guide" width="300" height="300">
      <li>Run back up to the entrance immediately after. You can try to take the aggro of a waterfiend to save a dragon slap.</li>
      <li>Wait another 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Go back on that tile.</li>
      <li>You can now loot the skeleton from that tile without getting attacked from spawning skeletons. Hop and repeat.</li>
      <li>???</li>
      <li>Profit!</li>
      <li>PS: The rummage damage scales slightly with your current hitpoints. If you only eat when below 10 hp, you can't die and get more rummages per inventory of food.</li>
